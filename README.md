This is a personal project to get a general overview of the apartment market in Germany. In particular, the focus is on Cologne (city center and surrounding area), because I want to move there soon.

* What prices can be expected? 
* Which areas are particularly expensive or cheap? 
* What does an average apartment in Cologne look like?
